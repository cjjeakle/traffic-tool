# traffic-tool
A tool to determine your average speed in stop-and-go traffic over certain time windows. You can use this information to travel near your average speed, ideally resulting in a smoother, less frustrating drive.

Visit [this project's page](http://cjjeakle.github.io/traffic-tool) from your smartphone to try it out!

## The Premise:
I originally got to thinking about this kind of tool after reading [an article](http://trafficwaves.org/) likening traffic slow-downs to waves. It made incredible sense. By traveling at or below your average speed across a window of traffic, you ideally won't need to slow down for temporary pockets of slow speed.

This [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lqdzo/traffic_engineers_what_causes_the_pulsatile_flow/) has some great videos and explanations, too.

This tool was created to calculate a moving average of your speed, which gives you a ballpark target speed to maintain. By traveling at or below your average speed, you shouldn't need to speed up and slow down with stop-and-go traffic. Instead you can travel at the average all those changes in speed, making for a smoother ride, less wear on your car, and perhaps even a less frustrating day.

Of course, this tool is an experiment. It's entirely possible knowing your current average speed over some window will have no bearing on your average speed on upcoming stretches of road. As always with free software of this sort, caveat emptor.
