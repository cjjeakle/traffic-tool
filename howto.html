            I designed this tool after reading through <a href="http://trafficwaves.org/">a site</a> likening traffic slow-downs to compression in a longitudinal wave. The comparison made incredible sense. Based on this, one can travel at or below their average speed across a window of traffic and smooth out the more compressed sections. This allows you to travel at a constant rate, avoiding temporary pockets of low speed.

            Beyond that site, this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lqdzo/traffic_engineers_what_causes_the_pulsatile_flow/">Reddit thread</a> features some intuitive, in-depth videos and explanations.

            <b>This tool calculates a moving average of your speed, which gives you a ballpark target speed to maintain. By traveling at or below the average of your stopping and going, you can defer or even avoid slowing down in traffic.</b> This can make for a smoother ride, less wear on your car, and perhaps even a less frustrating day.

            Of course, this tool is an experiment. It's entirely possible knowing your current average speed over some window in time will have no bearing on your average speed during upcoming stretches of time. As always with free software and experiments of this sort, caveat emptor.
