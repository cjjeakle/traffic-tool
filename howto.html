            This tool tracks your average speed over 1-minute and a 5-minute intervals. Ideally you can use this information while in dense stop-and-go traffic to avoid having to come to a full stop, making for a smoother overall drive. You can avoid coming to a full stop by traveling at the average speed of all your stopping and starting.

            You can also compare the 1 and 5 minute intervals, to see how your average speed is changing over time. This is more for your own information, as it's not particularly actionable.

            This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lqdzo/traffic_engineers_what_causes_the_pulsatile_flow/">Reddit thread</a> has some great videos and explanations regarding traffic. It gives some insight into how driving at a slower, more consistent speed can (counter-intuitively) make things better.
